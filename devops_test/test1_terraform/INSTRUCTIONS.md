# DevOps Test 1 – Terraform (Candidate Instructions)

This test uses Terraform with the `hashicorp/local` provider.
In `main.tf` you will find a very simple example that creates a single file for the `QA` environment.

Your task is to extend this configuration.

## Goal

Modify the Terraform configuration so that it creates:

- Three environments: `QA`, `STG`, and `PRD`.
- For **each** environment, **10 files** named:
  - `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, ..., `file10.txt`
- Each file must live under its environment folder, for example:
  - `QA/file1.txt`, ..., `QA/file10.txt`
  - `STG/file1.txt`, ..., `STG/file10.txt`
  - `PRD/file1.txt`, ..., `PRD/file10.txt`

The exact content of each file is up to you, but it should be clearly related to the environment and/or file number.

Example:
QA/file1.txt
-   content  = "This is file number 1 for QA env generated by terraform, The user inputed text is : I will do well here"

QA/file10.txt
-   content  = "This is file number 10 for QA env generated by terraform, The user inputed text is : See its easy"

## How to run

You can assume Terraform is already installed.

1. Initialize:

   terraform init

2. Review the execution plan:

   terraform plan

3. Apply the changes (only if you are comfortable):

   terraform apply

After applying, you should see the generated files under the corresponding environment folders (`QA/`, `STG/`, `PRD/`).

## Take notes for what and why you did.
## We will discuss it later.
